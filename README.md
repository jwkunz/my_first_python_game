# Radiant Pupils
This repository contains curriculum for a class teaching students grades 7 - 12:
*  How computers work
*  The role of operating systems
*  How computers are networked
*  How to develop simple applications in Python
*  How to perform simple scientific computing in Python using Jupyter Notebooks

This repository does not emphasize teaching all the specifics of the Python language because there are many other freely available sources to teach that content.

## Structure
The class is organized with a series of lessons described in numbered markdown documents within the `/lessons` folder.  Each lesson contains a theory section and labratory exercise.

Some of the laboratory exercises requires writing code to solve problems.  The `/problems` folder contains the start point for these exercises.  The `/solutions` folder contains fully working examples for students to compare their work.

## Environment Depedencies
The class curriculum makes efforts to be cross-platform for student running Linux, Windows, and macOS, but in the author's opinion students will have the best learning outcomes by using Ubuntu 2025.
The python instruction is peformed in the beginner friendly Anaconda environment.

You can recreate the environment via:
`conda env create -f environment.yml`
